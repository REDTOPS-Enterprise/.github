# 📜 The REDTOPS Contribution

So, you want to contribute to a REDTOPS project? Good. We need more hands on the keyboard and fewer people talking about "best practices" in the cafeteria. 

At **REDTOPS Enterprise**, we have a specific way of doing things. We call it **The Vibe Protocol**. Follow it, and we’ll get along fine. Ignore it, and you’ll be demoted to "Manual Documentation Entry" for a month.

## 🧠 The "Brain-First" Policy (The AI Reality Check)

Look to get something out of the way, we talk about "vibe coding," but let’s get one thing straight: **REDTOPS is not an AI company. We’re a Software Company.** We are operating with beating hearts. We value human intuition, grit, and the ability to solve a problem with nothing but a text editor and a caffeinated brain. 

We aren't here to let a machine do all of our thinking for us. We do what is best for the software, period.

**You should follow these tipes when using Generative AI:**
* **Use ONLY it when you’re stuck:** If you’re staring at a C++ template error for three hours and the void is starting to stare back, ask the clanker for a ladder. 
* **Use it for the grunt work:** If you need to generate 500 lines of repetitive boilerplate so you can get to the "cool stuff," let the machine sweat.
* **DON'T let it drive:** If you don't understand the code the AI gave you, **DON'T submit it.** We don't hire algorithms; we hire people who know how to use them. 

AI is a power tool, like a jackhammer—it’s great for breaking ground, but you wouldn't use it to perform surgery right? **Use your head first.**

## 🎭 Culture & Stability (The "Human" Element)

Also one thing, we’re sometimes serious about performance, but we aren't boring. You’ll find jokes in the comments, weird variable names in the experimental branches, and a general lack of "corporate stiffness." Most of us at **REDTOPS** like to keep things light while we’re pushing the hardware to its limit.

**A Note on Stability:**
Because we move fast and "vibe" hard, things can get... shaky. If you’re the type of developer who enjoys taking our high-speed chaos and finding ways to **stabilize** it without killing much of the performance, we love you. Seriously. If you can make our mad-scientist experiments actually survive a production environment, you’re doing the Lord’s work. We thank you, and the hardware thanks you.

## 🟢 How to Contribute
But anyway with all that out of the way there is 5 simple steps when working or voluteering with us.

1.  **Identify a Bottleneck:** If something is slow, it’s an insult to the brand. Fix it.
2.  **Fork and Hammer:** Grab the repo, create a branch or work with someone, and start coding. 
3.  **The "Vibe" Test:** Before you submit a Pull Request, run the code. If it smokes the CPU but completes the task in record time, you’re on the right track.
4.  **Verify the Logic:** If you used a tool to help you, double-check the math. We don't ship "hallucinations."
5.  **Communication:** Communication is key! Use it, it helps out a lot in the long run!

## ⚠️ The Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ DO:
* **Prioritize Performance:** If you can save 2ms by writing a slightly "unreadable" bit of assembly, do it. We’ll hire someone to read it later.
* **Be Bold:** If a feature in AmberLink or REDLINE is "stable" but boring, make it "unstable" but revolutionary. (We're kidding of course careful with instablities!)
* **Document the "Why":** We can see *how* the code works by looking at it. Tell us *why* you decided to ignore the memory safety warnings for the sake of speed.

### 🛑 DON'T:
* **Don't Ship Bloat:** If your PR adds a 20gb dependency just to sort a list, we will find you.
* **Don't "Clean Code" us to Death:** If you rewrite a high-speed function into three "cleaner" nested functions that run 70% slower, your PR will be closed immediately.
* **Don't Ask for Permission:** If you see a way to make REDLINE 2x faster, don't open an issue asking if you should. **Do it.** Then show us the benchmark.

## 🚀 Submission Guidelines

When you open a Pull Request, keep the description short:
1.  **What it does.**
2.  **How much faster it is (Show us the benchmarks!).**
3.  **Human vs. Tool ratio:** Tell us if this was 100% brain power or if you had to ask an LLM for a boost.

**REDTOPS Enterprise: Breaking things so you don't have to.**
