# ⚖️ REDTOPS Enterprise Licensing Policy

At **REDTOPS**, we believe in two things: high-speed code and knowing who owns what. We don't like legal bloat any more than we like code bloat, so we keep our licensing simple.

## 🌍 Public & Open Source Projects
For most of our public-facing tools (like **REDLINE** or parts of **AmberLink**), we typically use the **MIT License** or **Apache 2.0**.

**The Logic:** We want these tools in the hands of every developer who is tired of slow/shitty software. 
* **MIT:** We wrote it, it’s fast, don't sue us if you use it to melt your CPU.
* **Apache 2.0:** Same as above, but with more "legal armor" regarding patents. 

*Check the specific `LICENSE` file in the root of each repository to see which one applies.*

## 🔒 Internal & Proprietary Projects
If you’ve stumbled into a repository labeled **Internal**, **Experimental**, or **Classified** (looking at you, **REDTOPS Shell** u fucking cunt), the rules are different.

**The Logic:**
This is our "Secret Sauce." You can look if proper perms are set, but you can’t touch and you definitely can’t sell it.
* These projects are **Copyright © REDTOPS Enterprise**. 
* No part of these repositories may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted without the express written permission of the **Chief Executive Visionary (CEV)**. 
* If you’re a authroized contributor, your work on these projects falls under the RTE Intellectual Property Agreement.

## 🛠 Which License Should I Use?

If you are starting a new project in our group, follow these guidelines:

1.  **Is it a Library or Language? (Or maybe something public related?)** Use **MIT**. We want the world to use our syntax.
2.  **Is it a Tool or Enterprise Utility?** Use **Apache 2.0**. It’s cleaner for corporate use.
3.  **Is it a Core RTE Asset?** Use **Proprietary**. Keep the keys to the kingdom inside the house.
(U may ask questions if ur still unsure.)

## 📜 Final Legal Disclaimer
Regardless of the license, **REDTOPS Enterprise** is not responsible for:
* Hardware failure due to extreme optimization.
* Sentient AI code attempting to rewrite your BIOS. (KIDDING OF COURSE!)
* Any loss of sleep caused by trying to understand our projects.

**Use the code. Break the limits. END THE WORLD if you so wanted to. Just don't steal the brand.**
