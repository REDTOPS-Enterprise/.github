# 📂 REDTOPS Enterprise: The "We Already Know" FAQ

Let’s skip the small talk. You have questions, we’ve heard them all before somewhere else. Here is the reality of how we operate at **REDTOPS Enterprise (RTE)**.

### 🏛️ Organization & Vision

#### Q: Why is an entertainment studio kidnapping a systems programming brand?
**A:** Why not? **Parafield Studios** does its own shit. We may also build the specialized stuffs that helps Parafield jump forward, light-years ahead of what standard tools allow.

#### Q: Why build new languages/tools instead of using what's already out there?
**A:** I mean, the existing tools are fine. They work for most people, and if we really, *really* need to use them to get a job done, we will. We aren't masochists. 

But "fine" isn't the goal. We want to do things in our own way—ways that current standards don't allow for. We’re building our own road because we want a different kind of performance and a different kind of workflow. We only reinvent the wheel when the current wheel is slowing us down or heading in the wrong direction.

#### Q: Is REDTOPS just a playground for Parafield projects?
**A:** No. While RTE provides the "boost" for Parafield, projects like **REDLINE** and **AmberLink** are built to stand on their own. We’re building for the entire software space. If it makes a Parafield project run at 200% efficiency, it’ll probably do the same for your projects too.

### 🛠️ Engineering & AI

#### Q: "Vibe Coding"? Does that mean you guys use AI for EVERYTHING?
**A:** **Absolutely NOT.** If you use AI for every line of code, you aren't a real engineer. At RTE, we value human intuition above all else. 

We use AI as a high-pressure tool to solve specific, stubborn bottlenecks or to grind through repetitive boilerplate. But if you can't explain the logic behind the code you submit, **don't ship it.** Use the tools; don't let the tools use you.
And remember what we said before: "AI is a power tool, like a jackhammer—it’s great for breaking ground, but you wouldn't use it to perform surgery right? **Use your head first.**"

#### Q: Is this stuff stable?
**A:** We may push the limits and fuck with projects sometimes, but we aren't stupid. We use **Beta Branches** for a reason. That’s where we break things and experiment. Before anything touches a Production release, we may run a gauntlet of hotfixes to ensure it actually works. We value breakthroughs, but we value the user experience enough to make sure our "mad science" doesn't brick your machine and we both end up in a courtroom. We also deeply value any contributors who may help us stabilize the chaos, but we may not always prioritize "safety" over "breakthroughs" during beta developments.

### 🎭 Culture & Tone

#### Q: What’s with the aggressive attitude?
**A:** We’re building high-performance systems, not a knitting circle. We move fast, we speak our minds, and we don't have time for corporate fluff. Plus most of us may like a bit of cave johnson sooo-

#### NOTE: A Note on our Culture
**Sorry (not sorry) about the jokes.** We do realize our if our w.i.p documentation, commit messages, and comments can be unconventional sometimes. We like to joke around, we have a specific sense of humor, and we don't do "corporate professional." 

If a variable name or a README note seems a bit wild, it’s because we’d rather enjoy our work than be bored by it. We’re human beings, not PR machines. If we offended your sensibilities with a joke about a segfault, our bad. but we’re probably going to do it again-
